As if!🤗 There is no secret about me after you read this page!

Who I am
=====

Hi, there! I'm Jingwei, and you can also call me Chris😎. Currently, I am an undergrad at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), set to graduate in 2025. I am studying for a dual degree, and my majors always seem confusing to people🤣: My first major is Physics and Mathematics (not as horrifying as it sounds, luckily), and my second major is Electrical Engineering.

Research
=====

Currently, I am working as a research intern with PhD student [Guangxuan Xiao](https://guangxuanx.com/), under the advisory of Prof. [Song Han](https://hanlab.mit.edu/songhan) at [HanLab](https://hanlab.mit.edu/). Initially, I worked as a research intern at [THUNLP](https://github.com/thunlp) under the advisory of Prof. [Zhiyuan Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/) for 6 months.

I mainly focus on Natural Language Processing. However, I tried diverse domains within this field: I dived into the multi-agent domain by working on the project [AgentVerse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10848) at THUNLP, and I also explored the efficient LLM domain by working on the head pruning of LLMs at HanLab(ongoing, nothing to share, my apologies). I love to explore multiple domains because doing so helps me acquire a wider and more comprehensive perspective of one certain field when I first enter it. Nevertheless, I didn't just scratch the surface of each domain -- I will stick to it until I fully completed at least one project in that domain, or can't dig anything out after several months of endeavors.

Fun Experiences
------

I went to Northeastern University for a one-semester exchange program in 2023 Fall and had a gorgeous time there. I love traveling around and have been to Hong Kong, Macao, Japan, Singapore, Australia, the US and of course many places of interest in mainland China.

Fun Facts About Me
------

When I get nervous, I like to scratch my hair😬. So next time you see me doing that in a debate, you know you've got me there.

Hobbies
------

I love playing tennis🎾 because smashing the ball just feels great. I also like listening to all kinds of music🎶, ranging from Mandopop (e.g. Jay Chou) to classical music (e.g. Chaikovski). Sometimes I sing👨‍🎤, but I feel bad if I don't sing well. I like driving🚗, despite the fact that I don't have a driver's license. I like to drink coffee☕ made from medium roasted coffee beans mixed with whole milk (I especially like Organic Valley Grass Fed Whole Milk🐄 (Not an AD!)). Sugar can be added, but not much, because I want to keep fit💪.
