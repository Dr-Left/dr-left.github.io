I am an undergrad at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), set to graduate in 2025. I study at [Weiyang College](https://www.wyc.tsinghua.edu.cn/#), majoring in **Foundamental Science** and **Electrical Engineering**. Currently, I am working as a research intern with PhD student [Guangxuan Xiao](https://guangxuanx.com/), under the advisory of Prof. [Song Han](https://hanlab.mit.edu/songhan). Initially, I worked as a research intern at [THUNLP](https://github.com/thunlp) under the advisory of Prof. [Zhiyuan Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/).


Research
=====

TL;DR
-----

- Multi-agents
- Efficient models

I mainly focus on Natural Language Processing. However, I tried diverse domains within this field: I dived into the **multi-agent** domain by working on the project [AgentVerse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10848) at THUNLP, and I also explored the **efficient LLM** domain by working on the head pruning of LLMs at HanLab.

I love to explore multiple domains because doing so helps me acquire a wider and more comprehensive perspective of one certain field when I first enter it. Nevertheless, I didn't just scratch the surface of each domain -- I will stick to it until I fully completed at least one project in that domain, or can't dig anything out after several months of endeavors.

Fun Experiences
------

I went to [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) for a one-semester exchange program in 2023 Fall and had a gorgeous time there. I love traveling around and have been to Hong Kong, Macao, Japan, Singapore, Australia, the US and of course many places of interest in mainland China.

Fun Facts About Me
------

When I get nervous, I like to scratch my hairüò¨. So next time you see me doing that in a debate, you know you've got me there.

Hobbies
------

I love playing tennisüéæ because smashing the ball just feels great. I also like listening to all kinds of musicüé∂, ranging from Mandopop (e.g. Jay Chou) to classical music (e.g. Tchaikovski). Sometimes I singüë®‚Äçüé§, but I feel bad if I don't sing well. I like to travel and explore new places:). I also like to drink coffee‚òï made from medium roasted coffee beans mixed with whole milk (I especially like Organic Valley Grass Fed Whole MilküêÑ (Not an AD!)). (Sugar can be added, but not much, because I want to keep fitüí™.)
