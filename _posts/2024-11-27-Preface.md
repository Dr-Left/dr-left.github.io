I am on a train from Beijing to Wuxin right now. Sometimes I believe one's life is just like traveling on a train...


## Disclaimer

Forgive me, I am not a native English speaker, so some expressions may seem a bit wierd. 

## Statement of Purpose

I created this blog, with the aim to bring more values to people. I hope they might help a person staying up late removing some bugs within a piece of code in desperation, make a confused person standing in front of life crossroads yell: "I have the same feelings! So it is OK to have these feelings!", or just serve as after-dinner talks like: "I know this guy even did this or that when he was young! -- No way!"

## Who I am

I am a simple person, doing simple things in a simple world. I have no special skills, no super powers, no. I would cry when I feel bad, I would laugh when I feel happy. All in all, I am just a normal person.

## Dedications

To Olivia Li, who encouraged me when I said I would like to create a blog, who I love. I feel lucky to have known her.
