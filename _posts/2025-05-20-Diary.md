I woke up in the morning

I slept at night.



I am hesitating whether I should make my thesis

carefully or just whip it up.



My life is meant for something more than this dull and repetitive work.

Yesterday, when I was swimming, I had a sudden realization about life. Let me explain.



I was swimming. I could swim, but I felt extremely afraid of the feeling of having my head under the water, somehow, yesterday.



I told myself: I could swim. And I must swim. If I didn’t swim from this end to the other without pause, I was a loser.



I felt so much panic and agony when I tried to do that and I couldn’t catch my breath. I already had much water in my nasal cavity.

I stopped. I failed.



I realized I was too hard on myself. I just cannot swim that fast for that long. I need more time to have my own pace, to be in my own rhythm.



I slowed down. I swam like a lazy frog on a Sunday afternoon, with nothing on its mind, no female frog to proposition, no flies to seek.

I survived the 25 m-long lane.



I realized in my life, I pushed myself too hard. I was wanting too much.

If I give up 50% of what I want, my life might be over 200% happier.

Remember, more is not always better. 

You've got your own niche. You've got your own pace.
